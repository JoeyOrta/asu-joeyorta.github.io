            <h2>The Journey</h2>
            <p>
                Starting as an independent artist, YEOJI gained small attention for their ability to blend ambient and liquid drum n bass melodies
                 with the mixtape <strong>Medal</strong>. Effeminacy, YEOJI's debut album, introduced listeners to a world of ethereal 
                 soundscapes, emotional narratives, and dramatic experimental beats. Now, YEOJI is starting to drift into more electronic pop with his new releases of
                  <strong>HALFWAY</strong> and <strong>DIGITAL SPACE</strong>, seemingly about to release a new album.

            <h2>Influence</h2>
            <p>
                Drawing inspiration from futuristic concepts, modern relationships, and emotional complexity, 
                YEOJI crafts music that resonates on a deeply personal level while challenging traditional electronic genres. His main inspirations come from electronic artists Sega Bodega and Arca.

            <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Effeminacy</strong> is a bold commentary on gender and emotion. As YEOJI was growing up, he faced difficulty with defining his gender based on societal standards of men. 
                Eventually, YEOJI would come to the conclusion that he IS a man whether society deems it or not. Gender is an emotion, an experience, and an identity that YEOJI likes to write about. </li>
                <li>YEOJI's work frequently includes collaborations with digital visual artists, enhancing live performances with immersive visuals.</li>
                <li>The artist prefers creating music in the dead of night, channeling the quiet ambiance into their soundscapes.</li>
